# KeepAlive

This program was created to prevent certain applications from sleeping or going
inactive. This program uses the Robot Java class to perform left mouse clicks
for a specified number of times within a specified area of the screen. The
target application (the application you want to prevent from going inactive)
should be positioned on the screen in such a way that when this Stay Alive
application runs, the cursor will position itself within the target application,
perform a left mouse click and then sleep the main thread for a specified period
of time.
